# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
### The note tracker application should take, save and delete notes on a page.
### The front-end of the application was provided and I needed to develop the backend of the application. It uses Express.js to run the back-end to save and retrieve data from a JSON file.
### The application has also been uploaded and should be deployed with Heroku.

## Bugs
### The application has not been able to run in the Heroku. It continuously has been getting a timeout error in which I have tried to fix by adding a script start to the package.json file, adding a connect-timeout & have tried to create intiial notes data in db.json to help.
